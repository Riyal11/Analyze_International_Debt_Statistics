## Introduction

Welcome to the International Debt Data Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing international debt data provided by The World Bank. Through SQL queries and data exploration, we aim to gain insights into global debt trends, identifying key countries, and understanding debt composition.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- Calculate the total accumulated debt across all countries.
- Identify the country with the highest debt and its corresponding amount.
- Explore the average debt amount across different debt indicators.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from The World Bank's international debt statistics. It contains information about debt amounts in USD for various developing countries.

## Methodology

The analysis involves:
1. Connecting to the `international_debt` database.
2. Running SQL queries to extract relevant information.
3. Calculating total debt, identifying the highest debtor, and computing average debt.
4. Visualizing key findings using graphs and charts.

## Repository Structure

- `queries/`: Contains SQL queries for data analysis.
- `results/`: Contains output files and visualizations.
- `images/`: Store images used in the README.

Additionally, the main Jupyter Notebook file for the project is located at [`analysis.ipynb`](Analysis.ipynb). This notebook contains all the commands and explanations for the data analysis process, along with the dataset used.

Feel free to explore and navigate through the different directories to get a comprehensive understanding of the project structure.
